Ondo Finance is a project that aims to narrow the gap between DeFi and TradFi (Decentralized Finance and Traditional Finance). Acting and dominating the RWA sector (Real World Assets), Ondo achieves it by transforming institutional grade assets such as US Treasuries into tokens that can be traded in the blockchain. The 2 main products in the Ondo inventory is the USDY and OUSG. 

The USDY is a tokenized secure note. It not classified as a stable coin but is very similiar to one and we can make a quick comparison to understand the differences between a traditional stable coin and USDY.

| Bankruptcy-remoteness          | Stablecoins are generally issued out of operating companies. If a stablecoin issuer went bankrupt, including for reasons unrelated to operating their respective stablecoins, holders may be unable to redeem                                | USDY is issued by Ondo USDY LLC, a company that is designed to be bankruptcy-remote from any other entities, including Ondo operating companies                                                                               |
| Yield                          | Stablecoin holders receive no direct interest                                                                                                                                                                                                | USDY holders receive yield generated from the underlying assets (less amounts to satisfy fees, obligations, and expenses) in the form of increasing redemption value                                                          |
| Secured by high-quality assets | Stablecoins are generally unsecured liabilities of their issuers with no security interest in the assets that back them and are at risk of being subordinated to the claims of other creditors                                               | USDY holders have a security interest in the assets that back it, and USDY is the only debt of Ondo USDY LLC                                                                                                                  |
| Regulatory status              | Stablecoins exist in a regulatory gray area and are not structured in a way to be able to pay holders a yield                                                                                                                                | USDY will be issued in compliance with US federal and state securities and financial crime compliance laws                                                                                                                    |
| Third-party oversight          | Stablecoin issuers can, in many cases, unilaterally change the type of assets that back them                                                                                                                                                 | Ankura Trust Company protects USDY holders as Verification Agent and Collateral Agent, enforcing narrow eligibility criteria and is able to force a wind-down in an event of non-compliance                                   |
| Timely redemptions             | If stablecoin issuers fail to meet redemption requests within a timely manner, there would be no Event of Default nor automatic wind-down process. Rather, stablecoin holders would likely need to litigate in court to recover their assets | If Ondo USDY LLC fails to meet a redemption request in a timely manner, an Event of Default will occur, mandating Ankura Trust to liquidate the investment portfolio and repay token holders, subject to USDY holder approval |
